## Q1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
To establish a new habit, attach it to an existing routine, making it tiny and easy to do, while celebrating your accomplishment to reinforce the behavior.

## Q2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
According to Dr. BJ Fogg, a behavior (B) occurs when three factors align: the desire or motivation (M) to perform the behavior, the ability (A) to carry it out, and a prompt (P) to initiate it. In simpler terms, your motivation, ability, and a trigger need to coincide for a behavior to happen. "B = MAP" is a model for habit formation:
- Behavior (B): This is the habit you're trying to make a part of your life.
- Motivation (M): It's your reason for wanting to do this habit.
- Ability (A): This means making the habit easy and doable.
- Prompt (P): These are reminders or cues that help you remember to do the habit.

## Q3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
Celebrating when you succeed with a habit is vital because it makes you feel good about it, which encourages you to do it again. These good feelings build up over time and make the habit stick.
